# Purpose 
The purpose of this challenge is to show my skills using advanced CSS and HTML. Using these skills that I have developed, I have created a starting portfolio.  This portfolio will be able to be seen by future employers.  

# User Story 
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria 
<ul> 
<li>GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them </li>
<li>WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section <li> 
<li> WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications </li>
<li>WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others </li>
<li>WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application</li>
<li> WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
